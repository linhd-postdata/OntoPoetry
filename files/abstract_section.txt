 The richness, variety, and different study`s perspectives that scholars find in their studies is a 
 highly complex challenge but this challenge is even more noticed in the poetry genre,where each poetic 
 tradition has independently developed its analytical terminology and methodology.
Ontopoetry  addresses the construction of a poetry ontology to express the scholarÂ´s knowledge and has been developed
   following NeOn methodology.
It has been structured in three modules:
    a) core, 
    b) poetic analysis and 
    c) transmission, covering the essential aspects in a poetry literary study. 
Here we present core module, its classes and relationships and the design decisions taken during 
the process. OntoPoetry core module has been aligned with FRBRoo ontology guaranteeing its interoperability.
