<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This ontology is the core of the POSTDATA network of ontologies. As such, it contains the most relevant classes and properties that allow representing poetic works and their characteristics. Besides, it contains common classes and properties that are used in many other ontologies in the network, such as those related to the representation of persons, organisations, events, places and roles that persons and organisations play in poetic works.</span>
